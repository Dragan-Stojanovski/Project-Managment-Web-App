											The Green Buildings Career Map identifies
											<strong>32 jobs</strong> in the Energy Efficiency industry
											that do not require a college degree. In fact, a recent
											study by a major job-recruiting company found that just
											21% of the jobs posted on its website specifically ask
											that candidates have a college degree. The U.S. Labor
											Department says the country is facing a significant
											shortfall of skilled workers. Many companies are no longer
											looking for white-collar or blue-collar workers, but
											instead{" "}
											<em>
												<u>new-collar</u>
											</em>{" "}
											workers: individuals who develop the technical and soft
											skills needed to work in jobs through nontraditional
											education paths. New-collar workers do not have a
											four-year degree from college. Instead, new-collar workers
											gain skills through on-the-job training, high school
											technical education, on-the-job apprenticeships,
											vocational schools, technical certification programs,
											community colleges, the military, and internships. The
											mid-level and advanced-level new-collar jobs identified in
											this career map typically require more experience or
											certification to advance.
